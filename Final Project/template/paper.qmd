  Recent studies have argued that democratizing does not lead to more redistributive economic policies. Implementing two new measures of democratic progress that better capture the expansion of political power to lower classes, I investigate the relationship between increased access to political participation and inheritance tax rates, following Scheve & Stasavage. I find some evidence of a relationship between _Equal Access to Political Power_ and top inheritance tax rates. POSSIBLE EXTENSIONS
  1. ADDING IN VICE PROVINCE LEVEL CITIES OR DOING TESTS ONLY ON THEM 
  2. Connecting R&D to economic growth. New dataset that classifies infrastructure types. Want to identify if science and technology infrastructure projects might have a larger effect on both city mayor and provincial leader promotion through the connection of R&D. Also want to see if R&D has effect on economic growth 
  3. Just use unemployment rate as measure of economic growth with emphasis on human capital not just purely monetary GDP that might only be representative of the most richest in society
  4. Maybe instead of dummy variable of subway approval, might measure amount of contract

# Introduction

Political representation is a topic of major importance as increasingly, all over the world, there are actions being taken to have governmental and corporate leadership accurately represent the constituents that it serves or that keeps it operational. Political representation directly relates to the global phenomenon of citizens preferring candidates who share similar characteristics (cite Sevi). Sevi highlighted a reason for this, which is that citizens might believe that those similar to them are more likely to act in their best interest and enact policies that benefit their particular demographic.Different measures of representation include ethnicity, race, age, and many more dimensions (cite Sevi). However, representation and citizens voice in the matter only goes as far as the franchise reach. In China, which operates under a non-democratic government, politicians' political superiors take on the role of the voter (cite Lei & Zhou). In their paper, Lei & Zhou examine how local political exchanges that occur between Provincial Party Secretaries and City Mayors contribute to China's overly high long-term infrastructure investment relative to the rest of the world. This serves as a case study to examine heterogeneity across political parties at play in China on the provincial and city level, and further test the hypotheses that those voters, or in this case, those who influence the election or promotion of political leaders, are more likely to select those whom they are similar to.   @scheve2012  [@scheve2012]. **SK: This paragraph uses a footnote and a citation.**

A particular demographic, which has quite a standard trend in politics all around the world is age. Age is a unique demographic marker, as unlike other human characteristics such as gender or ethnicity, it is constantly changing along with time (cite S&S). According to Stockemer & Sundstr√∂m, political elite globally comprise of wealthy middle aged men (cite them). This is particularly troublesome, because just as age changes with time, so does ideologies, beliefs and viewpoints on life change with age, and as a result, young adults are usually at odds with older generations on policy and political solutions, and are therefore not adequately represented by their governments in their current state. (cite S&S) [@acemoglu2015democracy; @albertus2014gaming]. Lei & Zhou in their analysis of private cooperation among Chinese politicians provide an opportunity to identify whether age groups that fall on the margins of the status quo "politician age" are disadvantaged in any way in this political market system.  **SK: This paragraph uses multiple citations in a group. See <https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/footnotes-and-citations.html> for more.**


Another factor that relates to the topic of age in politics is tenure. The longer that a politician can remain in office translates into more exposure to political connections and opportunities to prove one's capability and prowess to superiors. For younger politicians, this is especially important, as they may need even more time to prove their expertise due to obstacles in initially securing opportunities based soley on their age, limited past tenure, and perceived inexperience. For much older politicians, we have the exact opposite problem, in which they almost have a fast approaching deadline to achieve results while in office. However, since older leaders have had more time tenured and therefore are perceived to be more experienced, it might not be as difficult for them to secure opportunities, such as infrastructure contracts. (Li et al) actually established a negative tenure effect on public infrastructure investment, in which a politician is more likely to invest more in public infrastructure at the beginning of their career, when they do not have many years of tenure under their belt and have much more to benefit from achieving positive results throughout the rest of their career. As a result, it would be expected that younger politicians would have the expectation of longer tenure years, which would have positive correlation with investments and therefore future promotion; whereas, older politicians would less tenured years, which could lead to less investment and therefore less chances of future promotion. This paper explores the intersection of tenure and the heterogeneous effects of age as a major player in the game between public infrastructure and private returns for a politician in China. 

# Analysis

The intuition of my proposal can be seen in @fig-agedist. The age distribution of both Provincial Party Secretaries and City Mayors overlap at ages roughly between 45 - 59 years, with the bulk of the overlap occurring between 52 - 57. As a result, it would make sense that city mayors who are closer in age to PPS(s) would have a higher chance of getting promotions based on the hypothesis proposed earlier.

Using data collected and compiled by Lei & Zhou, I utilize the Age variable by creating another grouping variable which comprises of bins of 6 age groups from the minimum age of 33 to the maximum age of 62, each bin comprising of 5 years. In order to prevent overlapping while creating the bins, the first term within an age group would be included in the previous age bin. I then added in this new Age group variable to the original difference in difference design through interaction terms with the independent variable of interest, which is Mayor's subway approval for that city in that year. I first replicate Lei & Zhou differences-in-differences design, and then I extend it by the adding the interaction terms of subway approval and age brackets; I further add in the control of the tenure of the mayor. This is because there might be some correlation between age and tenure, as explained above and controlling for tenure can extrapolate any specific heterogeneous effects based on age that is not affected by tenure. 

# Baseline Difference in Difference Design
The difference in difference design, as proposed in Lei & Zhou's paper can be represented with an ordinary least squares regression represented by: $$P_{ct} = \alpha + \beta_{1}Approval + \gamma X_{c,t - 1} + \eta_{c} + \theta_{t} + \epsilon_{ct},$$ where $P_{ct}$ is future promotion of the city mayor in 3 years for city *c* in year *t*. The City fixed effects ($\eta_{c}$) captures any time invariant characteristics of each city, which might also contribute to the prospects of a mayor's future promtoion, while year fixed effects captures city invariant characteristics that is unique to a particular year, which could also influence a mayor's chances of future promotion. This forms the basis of the difference in difference in design and allows us to make the causal claim that subway approval alone has some effect on the chances of the future promotion of a city Mayor 
@tbl-replication shows the main results of the Lei & Zhou original difference in differences design, which shows a statistically significant positive effect between a mayor securing an approval for Subway infrastructure and promotion of that mayor in 3 years across all specifications of the design with increasing levels of controls. On the base level, only including the fixed effects across city and time, a mayor who has secured an approval for a subway construction will see their chances of promotion in 3 years increase by 25 percentage points, which is quite economically significant. The other specifications also fall into this range of treatment effect, with the lowest effect coming in when the model includes Province year fixed effects

: Replication of Lei & Zhou Difference in Difference design {#tbl-replication}

However, to make sure that this difference in difference design is valid, it is important to ensure that the parallel trends assumption holds, which can be tested using the following model specification: . In this design, we're comparing mayors who received the treatment (which is securing a subway approval in this case) and comparing them to other mayors who did not receive the treatment across cities and years. However, to make a valid causal claim that getting a subway approval increases chances of future promotion, we have to ensure that, in the absence of treatment, the mayors who had gotten a subway approval would have trended, in terms of their chances of future promotion, in the same way that the mayors who did not receive the treatment. A way to visualize this is using the concept of leads and lags, as shown in @fig-parallel. The leads serve as a placebo test to determine if future treatment has any effect on present outcome, while lags represents the effect of past treatment of present outcome. From @fig-parallel, in which the year prior to actual year of treatment is not included to serve as a baseline for comparison, we can see that the leads, up to five years of future treatment, have no statistically significant effect on present outcome. The only worrisome estimate is the 4 year lead estimate, which has an effect of about 0.15 (15 percentage points) on future promotion; however, this effect is not statistically significant. As a result, the parallel trends assumption proves to be true in this case, as it shows us that there were no other characteristics at play here which other wise, even without treatment, had an effect on a mayor's chances of promotion.

# Heterogenous Effects Results I: Age 
I extend Lei & Zhow' study  by identifying heterogeneous effects, the first of which is based on age and is represented with the following ordinary least squares regression: $$P_{ct} = \alpha + \beta_{1}Approval + \beta_{2}Approval * Age group + \gamma X_{c,t - 1} + \eta_{c} + \theta_{t} + \epsilon_{ct},$$ 
@tbl-extension shows the main results of this extension. The table below shows that for the baseline group, getting a subway approval increased their promotion chances by 27.5 percentage points and this effect is statistically significant, which is in line with the conclusions of Lei & Zhou's paper. The age groups,  30-35 and 35-40, were dropped out of the final model results, as no observation in those groups received the treatment and therefore, their interaction coefficients with the treatment were zero and could be dropped. Every other age group, except the 40-45 age group, has lower chances in comparison, however, none of these differences are statistically significant. For age group, 40-45, attaining an approval for Subway construction in their city had a negative effect on their chances of getting a promotion in 3 years; in specific units, getting a subway approval decreased their chances of getting promoted by 11.7 percentage points and this effect is statistically significant through most of the specifications of the design. It is not statistically significant when the model includes province-year fixed effects, although the effect is still negative.

: Heterogenous Effects Based on Age {#tbl-extension}

The interaction coefficients for each model can be seen in figure 3 in the grid of marginal effects plot based on the age groups. In order to ensure that such significant effects were not driven by outliers, I further filtered the data based on age group to further examine the number of observations within groups, as well as determine how many observations actually received the treatment of attaining a subway approval. From these investigations, I found that the statistical differences for 40-45 age group was driven by an outlier, which was 1 observation out of a total of 410 observations within the group (only approximately 0.2% of the observations within that age group). In comparison, the other age groups had about 250 to 1480 observations with approximately 2-3% receiving the treatment. Based on this, I cannot conclude that there is any major heterogeneity among the City Mayors included in this study based on age.


# Heterogenous Effects Results II: Tenure 
Another variable which serves as an interesting case study to determine heterogeneity is the tenure of a mayor at the time at which they secure a subway approval. The second heterogenous effect model can also be represented with this ordinary least squares regression: $$P_{ct} = \alpha + \beta_{1}Approval + \beta_{2}Approval * Mayor Tenure + \gamma X_{c,t - 1} + \eta_{c} + \theta_{t} + \epsilon_{ct},$$ where $P_{ct}$ is future promotion of the city mayor in 3 years for city *c* in year *t*. @tbl-extension2 shows the main results, from which we can see that the interaction coefficient between Subway Approval and tenure has a positive effect on a mayors future promotion in 3 years, which is statistically significant. Substantively, a mayor who has had more years in tenure and has also secured a subway approval will see their chances of attaining a promotion in 3 years increased by 6 to 9 percentage points. The effect of only securing a subway approval without interacting with tenure are still positive as in all previous models, ranging from 1.9 to 6.4 percentage point increased likelihood, however, they are not statistically significant.

: Heterogeneous Effects Based on Tenure {#tbl-extension2}

The marginal effects plot, @fig-tenuremarg, also visualize the increasing likelihood of future promotion for a mayor with more years in tenure and a subway approval under their belt. The mechanism behind this might be that with more years tenured, a city mayor might be due for a promotion and having accomplishments to prove their qualifications, such as a subway approval which promotes economic growth and furthers the prospects of their superiors, plays a significant role in the future promotion of that mayor.

Adding a `{.appendix}` next to your section header makes it an Appendix.

Table \ref{tab:main-tex} is a table generated in LaTeX. LaTeX is a different language than R or markdown. So, we denote that we are using tex code explicitly by using the `{=tex}` tag. However, often quarto can detect LaTeX code. For example, the notation `\ref{tab:main-tex}` used in the top of this paragraph is tex code that quarto recognizes, and captures the number of the table.

The file `tables/scheve-regression.tex` can be generated in your R script. When you create the table with `modelsummary`, add `output = "gt"` inside `modelsummary()`, and saving the output of `modelsummary` into `gt::gtsave()`. For example, this uses a simple example:

![](figures/codesnippet.png){width="80%"}

Then, the code chunk starting with `{=tex}` in the quarto code will read in the tex table, and add additional environments around it. For more on these environments, see <https://www.overleaf.com/learn/latex/Environments> and the chapters in the website. ChatGPT should be quite good too at providing snippets of LaTeX code. All the teaching fellows and instructors can help with TeX.
