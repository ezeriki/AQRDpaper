  Recent studies have argued that democratizing does not lead to more redistributive economic policies. Implementing two new measures of democratic progress that better capture the expansion of political power to lower classes, I investigate the relationship between increased access to political participation and inheritance tax rates, following Scheve & Stasavage. I find some evidence of a relationship between _Equal Access to Political Power_ and top inheritance tax rates. POSSIBLE EXTENSIONS
  1. ADDING IN VICE PROVINCE LEVEL CITIES OR DOING TESTS ONLY ON THEM 
  2. Connecting R&D to economic growth. New dataset that classifies infrastructure types. Want to identify if science and technology infrastructure projects might have a larger effect on both city mayor and provincial leader promotion through the connection of R&D. Also want to see if R&D has effect on economic growth 
  3. Just use unemployment rate as measure of economic growth with emphasis on human capital not just purely monetary GDP that might only be representative of the most richest in society
  4. Maybe instead of dummy variable of subway approval, might measure amount of contract

# Introduction

Political representation is a topic of major importance as increasingly, all over the world, there are actions being taken to have governmental and corporate leadership accurately represent the constituents that it serves or that keeps it operational. Political representation directly relates to the global phenomenon of citizens preferring candidates who share similar characteristics (cite Sevi). Sevi highlighted a reason for this, which is that citizens might believe that those similar to them are more likely to act in their best interest and enact policies that benefit their particular demographic.Different measures of representation include ethnicity, race, age, and many more dimensions (cite Sevi). However, representation and citizens voice in the matter only goes as far as the franchise reach. In China, which operates under a non-democratic government, politicians' political superiors take on the role of the voter (cite Lei & Zhou). In their paper, Lei & Zhou examine how local political transactions that occur between Provincial Party Secretaries and City Mayors contribute to China's overly high long term infrastructure investment relative to the rest of the world. This serves as a case study to examine heterogeneity across political parties at play in China on the provincial and city level, and further test the hypotheses that those voters, or in this case, those who influence the election or promotion of political leaders, are more likely to select those whom they are similar to.   @scheve2012  [@scheve2012]. **SK: This paragraph uses a footnote and a citation.**

A particular demographic, which has quite a standard trend in politics all around the world is age. Age is a unique demographic marker, as unlike other human characteristics such as gender or ethnicity, it is constantly changing along with time (cite S&S). According to Stockemer & Sundstr√∂m, political elite globally comprise of wealthy middle aged men (cite them). This is particularly troublesome, because just as age changes with time, so does ideologies, beliefs and viewpoints on life change with age, and as a result, young adults are usually at odds with older generations on policy and political solutions, and are therefore not adequately represented by their governments in their current state. (cite S&S) [@acemoglu2015democracy; @albertus2014gaming]. Lei & Zhou in their analysis of private cooperation among Chinese politicians provide an opportunity to identify whether age groups that fall on the margins of the status quo "politician age" are disadvantaged in any way in this political market system.  **SK: This paragraph uses multiple citations in a group.

Another related factor to age as regard

# Analysis

The intuition of my proposal can be seen in @fig-example. The original authors' measure of democracy changes abruptly at universal suffrage, but my measures of Equal Access to Power and Civil Society to Power changes more gradually. \[**SK: See qmd code for an example to insert figures, add a caption, and add a label that you can then reference in text**\]

![Time Trends for Different Measures of Democratic Participation in the United Kingdom, 1816-2000](figures/image7.png){#fig-example width="50%"}

Using data collected from V-Dem of the two new measures of democratization, joint with the data used by [@scheve2012], I investigate the relationship between democracies that have given enough political power to their lower socioeconomic classes and redistributive taxation. I employ two main models. The first model uses a differences-in-differences approach that estimates the causal effect of democracy and wars of mass mobilization on inheritance taxation with an ordinary least squares regression represented by: $$T_{it} = \alpha + \beta_{1}D_{i,t - 1} + \beta_{2}W_{i,t - 1} + \gamma X_{i,t - 1} + \eta_{i} + \theta_{t} + \epsilon_{it},$$ where $T_{it}$ is the top inheritance tax rate for direct descendants for country *i* in year *t*.

# Results

@tbl-main shows the results of the regression. I find some evidence for the importance of considering inequities in access to power when investigating what causes increases in inheritance taxation. While inconsistent, some models find that the effect of the lagged Equal Access to Power index on top inheritance taxation is statistically significant.

\[**SK: The quarto code below puts in a figure into a markdown table and calls it a table. Inserting tables are more complicated than inserting figures, so a hack is to include the image of the table as I have done here. Alternatively, you can also ask R to generate tables in a .tex format and ask quarto read it in as a tex file. See Appendix.**\]

# Appendix {.appendix}

```{=tex}
\begin{table}
\caption{\textbf{tex version of modelsummary output}}
\label{tab:main-tex}
\input{tables/scheve-regression.tex}
\end{table}
```
Adding a `{.appendix}` next to your section header makes it an Appendix.

Table \ref{tab:main-tex} is a table generated in LaTeX. LaTeX is a different language than R or markdown. So, we denote that we are using tex code explicitly by using the `{=tex}` tag. However, often quarto can detect LaTeX code. For example, the notation `\ref{tab:main-tex}` used in the top of this paragraph is tex code that quarto recognizes, and captures the number of the table.

The file `tables/scheve-regression.tex` can be generated in your R script. When you create the table with `modelsummary`, add `output = "gt"` inside `modelsummary()`, and saving the output of `modelsummary` into `gt::gtsave()`. For example, this uses a simple example:

![](figures/codesnippet.png){width="80%"}

Then, the code chunk starting with `{=tex}` in the quarto code will read in the tex table, and add additional environments around it. For more on these environments, see <https://www.overleaf.com/learn/latex/Environments> and the chapters in the website. ChatGPT should be quite good too at providing snippets of LaTeX code. All the teaching fellows and instructors can help with TeX.
